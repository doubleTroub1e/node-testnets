# Node Testnet World

Welcome to my personal journey into the node testnet ecosystem! This repository is designed to simplify the process of starting and updating nodes, whether they run on a remote server or, as in my case, a local mini PC at home.

## Getting Started

To use this repository effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the `.env` File**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory. This file should securely store all sensitive data such as passwords, emails, and API keys.  
   **Example `.env` File:**  
   ```env
   NODE_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   NODE_EMAIL=youremail@example.com

2. **Project-Specific Information**

    Each project folder includes a `README.md` file containing additional steps or information unique to that project. Be sure to review these files before proceeding.
